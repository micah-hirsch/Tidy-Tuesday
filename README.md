My goal is to strengthen my data visualization skills, so I started participating in the TidyTuesday projects in January 2024. I may not be able to complete the project every week, but I plan on participating as much as I can. This repository contains my R code for creating my visualizations. I will also post my visualizations to my Twitter ([\@micahehirsch](https://twitter.com/MicahEHirsch)) and Bluesky ([\@micahehirsch.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/micahehirsch.bsky.social)) accounts. Please feel free to follow along!
